Pygame Drum Sampler
Welcome to the Pygame Drum Sampler! This program allows you to play pre-recorded drum samples or record your own using the number pad and the letter "r" on your keyboard. The program uses Pygame and Pyaudio library, which allows you to play and record audio.

How to use
To play a pre-recorded sample, simply press the corresponding number on the number pad.

To record a new sample, press the letter "r" on your keyboard. You will be prompted to press the number of the sample you wish to record over. Once you have selected a sample, you can begin recording by pressing the corresponding number on the number pad.

To stop recording, simply press the letter "r" again. Your new sample will be saved and can be played back using the number pad.
